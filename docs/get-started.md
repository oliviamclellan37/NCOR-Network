# Get Started with NCOR

Welcome to the Ontology Research & Development Network. This guide explains what NCOR is, why you might want to join, and how to get involved in our initiatives.

## What is NCOR?

The National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the field of ontology through fostering research centers in different countries around the world. We serve as:

- A coordinating hub for ontological research and education
- An international community of ontology experts and practitioners
- A provider of resources for implementing ontologies in various domains
- A facilitator of cross-cultural ontology development

NCOR promotes the development of high-quality, interoperable ontologies across diverse cultural perspectives and domains.

## Why Join NCOR?

Organizations and individuals join NCOR for several compelling reasons:

- **Knowledge Exchange:** Connect with leading experts in ontology research
- **Cross-Cultural Collaboration:** Participate in international initiatives
- **Access to Resources:** Leverage established ontologies like CCO and BFO
- **Implementation Support:** Get guidance on applying ontologies to real-world problems
- **Standards Development:** Contribute to emerging ontology standards
- **Community:** Join a network of researchers and practitioners

## How to Get Involved

### 1. Join Our Community

```bash
# Subscribe to our mailing list
# Join our Slack workspace
# Attend our next virtual meeting
```

### 2. Explore Our Resources

NCOR supports several ontology projects including:

| Project | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) | Upper-level ontology providing a framework for domain ontologies |
| Common Core Ontologies (CCO) | Mid-level ontology suite bridging BFO and domain ontologies |
| National Ontology Centers | Country-specific ontology research centers |

### 3. Attend Events and Working Groups

NCOR hosts regular events and working groups:

- Biweekly BFO-CCO Office Hours
- NCOR CCO Working Group meetings
- Annual ontology conferences and workshops
- Domain-specific ontology development initiatives

## Implementation Examples

Here's an example of how organizations use NCOR-supported ontologies:
