### What is NCOR?

The NCOR Network is dedicated to advancing the field of ontology throughout the world by, for example, promoting National Centers for Ontological Research in different countries around the world.

### What is the relationship between NCOR and CCO?

The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) is one of the ontology projects supported by NCOR. CCO provides a mid-level ontology suite that bridges upper ontologies like BFO with domain-specific implementations.

### How can I establish an NCOR center in my country?

Click the "Join NCOR" link and indicate your interest in starting an NCOR center. Shortly after, NCOR leadership will reach out to discuss establishing a national center for ontological research in your country. Each center maintains its cultural uniqueness while adhering to shared standards for disambiguation and interoperability.

### Where can I get training in ontology development?

NCOR offers various training opportunities through its national centers, including workshops, courses, and mentorship programs. Check the [working groups](/docs/events) page for more information.

### How can ontologies help with AI systems?

Ontologies provide semantic foundations for AI systems, ensuring that data is properly structured, unambiguous, and contextually relevant. This is especially important for cross-cultural AI applications where meaning may vary across contexts.
